# LoadPastEvents-Meetup-API

This project is to load the past events organized by @GDG-Jalandhar from Meetup API and bind them on the view using HTML, Bootstrap and Vue.js.

Vue.js is the open-source JavaScript framework used to build single page applications and user interfaces. 
To use Vue.js, we can go for CDN or we can install it using npm:
     * npm install vue
     
 
 To use this project, download the project in "develop-vue.js" branch and run the "HTML" file.
